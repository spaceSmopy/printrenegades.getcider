Your friendly neighborhood Renegades here, and can you believe that it's already well into February? WTF right?

A lot of things happened this last month and downtown LA has been buzzin with activity. Lot's of people expressing themselves with printed materials (if you catch our drift). We're always happy to lend a hand to those who feel the need to wear their opinion on their shirt.

We have a feeling we'll be printing more stuff like this in the coming months. Stay tuned.

We also had a chance to get to ISS last month and check all the latest and greatest in garment decoration as well as taking in some seminars and classes to bone up on our skills. It was cool to see screen printers and other garment decorators from all over the country there in different capacities as well as some familiar faces. It was a very wet weekend but we managed to get a picture while it was nice and sunny out.

<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Hopefully we'll see some you at the next one. In the mean time, we have orders coming in what seems to be non-stop so if you need us, we'll be manning the presses making sure we crank out these jobs to make way for the new ones!!</div>";s:10:"post_title";s:21:"Where Did January Go?";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:20:"where-did-january-go";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2020-04-17 19:48:47";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2020-04-17 19:48:47";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:0:"";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"1";}}
