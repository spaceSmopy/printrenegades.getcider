<p class="p3"><span class="s4"><b>File Types</b></span><span class="s3">: The ‚Äúbest‚Äù file types to send us are the original files. If your design was drawn or designed in Adobe Illustrator, the original Adobe Illustrator (ai) file is the ‚Äúbest‚Äù. If your design was made in Adobe Photoshop (psd), then send us that file with all the layers. With that said, we accept the following file types in order or priority; Adobe Illustrator (.ai), Encapsulated Post Script (.eps), Adobe Photoshop (.psd), Adobe PDF (.pdf), JPEG (.jpg), Portable Network Graphic (.png), or Tag Interleave Format (.tiff).</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Vector files are preferable since they are easily resizable without any degradation in image quality. Vector files include .ai, .eps and sometimes .pdf.<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬† </span>We will accept raster files (.psd, .jpg, .png. .tiff) as long as they are at least 300dpi and sized to their final print size or larger. Rasterized files can always be made smaller but are not as forgiving when trying to enlarge them and may result in pixilation and image degradation.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s4"><b>Print ready artwork:</b></span><span class="s3"><b> </b>When we ask for ‚ÄúPrint Ready‚Äù artwork, the main criteria we need your files to meet are that your files are the highest resolution available and are sized to the final print size. While we would like for your files to be at least 300 dpi, there are instances where a lower resolution will work as long as your artwork is sized to the dimensions you want it to be printed. (You can refer to our template page for help with sizing.) We will handle any color separation or halftone conversion ourselves since only we know how best to print your job with our equipment. Don‚Äôt worry though, you will always be sent a final mockup for approval before going to print with any goods.

</span><span class="s4"><b>Print size</b>:</span><span class="s3"> The screen sizes that we use are standard sizes set by the ASPA. They give us the ability to offer larger than normal print areas without raising the cost of the set up fees. The max print sizes that we offer are: </span></p>
